<p>So, how much does lead actually matter? That's a good question. And for me it all started with the gun debate. Now, the gun debate hinges on a single question, "does reduced availability of guns reduce crime?" There's lots of things people say on one side of the other about saving lives and numerous other things, but I personally do not care how I am killed - I prefer not to be dead. The data I've seen suggests that there is a tenuous link at best between guns and violence and depending on how you cherry-pick the data it can show whatever you want. That means to me: guns and violence aren't related. It's crazy I know, but then the much more interesting question becomes: </p><h1>What is correlated to violence?</h1><p>Well, poverty is a good start, as is upbringing, the vicious cycle of violence, and law enforcement. However, they aren't that related if you're a believer in hard science. Next we look at something like abortions a la the <a href="http://freakonomics.com/2005/05/15/abortion-and-crime-who-should-you-believe/">Freakonomics</a>. However, abortions, drugs, and poverty are all interrelated - and that's not great for finding a cause. I investigated smoking a whole lot in my past, and one of the things I found just fascinating was how hard it was to "prove" that smoking lead to lung cancer. See, the core problem with what I read is that <i>some </i>people don't get lung cancer. Those people tended to be rich. Well if smoking gives you lung cancer, why doesn't it give rich people lung cancer? I find this to be about the same issue. We're chasing ghosts is what's happening. Enter, my theory of poverty. Later I was at an international talk about poverty, and one of the people who questioned the speaker about our role in ending poverty asked, "how come then, by the US definition of poverty, only one in 300 people are not in poverty. That vast difference cannot lead us to ask how does one become impoverished, but how does one leave poverty - for that we need to focus on the wealthy and not the poor." This profoundly changed how I looked at a lot of problems, the people who are nonviolent are the same people don't die of lung cancer in many ways. That doesn't make a lot of sense at first, violence is exceedingly rare whereas lung cancer is exceedingly common, but hear me out. The attribute a person needs in life is to predict the consequences of their actions. Now I'm not saying that people in poverty, who do drugs, who get abortions, who don't finish school cannot predict the consequences of their actions, I'm saying they aren't as good at it as the wealthy, nonviolent, not-dying-of-lung-cancer-while-smoking people. And as a little thought exercise: imagine someone who could, with perfect accuracy predict the consequences of their own actions, just their own actions. That super-power would make this person exceedingly wealth, successful, healthy, and likely live a very long and happy life. It's not the most exciting power, but it virtually guarantees success against everything except randomness. This, I believe, is the attribute that causes violence. An acute case of bad luck, and poor predictive ability. </p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="25"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="26"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="27"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="28"><span data-reactid="29"><!-- react-empty: 30 --><h2 data-reactid="31"><a data-reactid="32">Lead and Violence</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="33"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="34"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="35"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="36"></div></section></div></div>

I find this to be about the same issue. We're chasing ghosts is what's happening. Enter, my theory of poverty. Later I was at an international talk about poverty, and one of the people who questioned the speaker about our role in ending poverty asked, \"how come then, by the US definition of poverty, only one in 300 people are not in poverty. That vast difference cannot lead us to ask how does one become impoverished, but how does one leave poverty - for that we need to focus on the wealthy and not the poor.\" This profoundly changed how I looked at a lot of problems, the people who are nonviolent are the same people don't die of lung cancer in many ways. That doesn't make a lot of sense at first, violence is exceedingly rare whereas lung cancer is exceedingly common, but hear me out. The attribute a person needs in life is to predict the consequences of their actions. Now I'm not saying that people in poverty, who do drugs, who get abortions, who don't finish school cannot predict the consequences of their actions, I'm saying they aren't as good at it as the wealthy, nonviolent, not-dying-of-lung-cancer-while-smoking people. And as a little thought exercise: imagine someone who could, with perfect accuracy predict the consequences of their own actions, just their own actions. That super-power would make this person exceedingly wealth, successful, healthy, and likely live a very long and happy life. It's not the most exciting power, but it virtually guarantees success against everything except randomness. This, I believe, is the attribute that causes violence. An acute case of bad luck, and poor predictive ability.
