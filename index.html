<p>Well, poverty is a good start, as is upbringing, the vicious cycle of violence, and law enforcement. However, they aren't that related if you're a believer in hard science. Next we look at something like abortions a la the <a href="http://freakonomics.com/2005/05/15/abortion-and-crime-who-should-you-believe/">Freakonomics</a>. However, abortions, drugs, and poverty are all interrelated - and that's not great for finding a cause. I investigated smoking a whole lot in my past, and one of the things I found just fascinating was how hard it was to "prove" that smoking lead to lung cancer. See, the core problem with what I read is that <i>some </i>people don't get lung cancer. Those people tended to be rich. Well if smoking gives you lung cancer, why doesn't it give rich people lung cancer? I find this to be about the same issue. We're chasing ghosts is what's happening. Enter, my theory of poverty. Later I was at an international talk about poverty, and one of the people who questioned the speaker about our role in ending poverty asked, "how come then, by the US definition of poverty, only one in 300 people are not in poverty. That vast difference cannot lead us to ask how does one become impoverished, but how does one leave poverty - for that we need to focus on the wealthy and not the poor." This profoundly changed how I looked at a lot of problems, the people who are nonviolent are the same people don't die of lung cancer in many ways. That doesn't make a lot of sense at first, violence is exceedingly rare whereas lung cancer is exceedingly common, but hear me out. The attribute a person needs in life is to predict the consequences of their actions. Now I'm not saying that people in poverty, who do drugs, who get abortions, who don't finish school cannot predict the consequences of their actions, I'm saying they aren't as good at it as the wealthy, nonviolent, not-dying-of-lung-cancer-while-smoking people. And as a little thought exercise: imagine someone who could, with perfect accuracy predict the consequences of their own actions, just their own actions. That super-power would make this person exceedingly wealth, successful, healthy, and likely live a very long and happy life. It's not the most exciting power, but it virtually guarantees success against everything except randomness. This, I believe, is the attribute that causes violence. An acute case of bad luck, and poor predictive ability. </p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="25"><!-- react-empty: 26 --></div></section><section id="4" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title color-bg section-bgcover-wo title-size-medium p-0 text-align-center group-order-normal  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="27"><div class="Component ls-fx-r fx-w-w j-c-between a-i-stretch" data-reactid="28"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-0 fx-b-66p w-100p ls-w-66p" data-reactid="29"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="30"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="31"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/e501ba684f32a7498d0e84326a92006f/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fe196c46de58bc620eb209d615fbce872ca69ef71.jpg&amp;width=1440" style="object-position:50.05805926206393% 43.05438023855577%;" data-reactid="32"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/e6243ce9de439929c87ef2ba246997b7/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fe196c46de58bc620eb209d615fbce872ca69ef71.jpg&amp;width=1280" style="object-position:50.05805926206393% 43.05438023855577%;" data-reactid="33"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/da74e52a64cb494287bf8f1e618b4a6e/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fe196c46de58bc620eb209d615fbce872ca69ef71.jpg&amp;width=720" style="object-position:50.05805926206393% 43.05438023855577%;" data-reactid="34"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/6d2f1e9d6bb48f3b40ac3b97066bb4d5/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fe196c46de58bc620eb209d615fbce872ca69ef71.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:50.05805926206393% 43.05438023855577%;" data-reactid="35"/><img class="color-loading" data-ratio="1.543197936814958" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/e501ba684f32a7498d0e84326a92006f/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fe196c46de58bc620eb209d615fbce872ca69ef71.jpg&amp;width=1440" style="object-position:50.05805926206393% 43.05438023855577%;" data-reactid="36"/></picture></div></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-2 ls-p-h-5 ls-p-v-8 fx-b-33p color-title" data-reactid="37"><!-- react-empty: 38 --><!-- react-empty: 39 --><!-- react-empty: 40 --><!-- react-empty: 41 --><!-- react-empty: 42 --><div class="Paragraph color-text t-a-j" data-reactid="43"><p data-reactid="44">It may seem strange to create a nonprofit aimed at reducing lead exposure, but as far as I can tell it is the most important thing that we can do today to improve society. Lead lowers intelligence and increases rates of violence when people are exposed to lead as children. And, as it turns out there&#x27;s no minimum, any amount will cause problems. Charities should generally be aimed at causes that are universally positive, like health, education, helping the underprivileged, or reducing crime - lead affects all of these things. In much the same way as eliminating smoking would save more people than healthcare currently does, I think reducing lead would do a lot more for helping a small group of the population than </p></div></div></div></section></div><section id="5" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="45"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="46"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="47"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="48"><span data-reactid="49"><!-- react-empty: 50 --><h2 data-reactid="51"><a data-reactid="52">Lead Free Mississippi</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="53"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="54"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="55"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="56"></div></section></div></div>

I investigated smoking a whole lot in my past, and one of the things I found just fascinating was how hard it was to \"prove\" that smoking lead to lung cancer. See, the core problem with what I read is that <i>some </i>people don't get lung cancer. Those people tended to be rich. Well if smoking gives you lung cancer, why doesn't it give rich people lung cancer? I find this to be about the same issue. We're chasing ghosts is what's happening. Enter, my theory of poverty. Later I was at an international talk about poverty, and one of the people who questioned the speaker about our role in ending poverty asked, \"how come then, by the US definition of poverty, only one in 300 people are not in poverty. That vast difference cannot lead us to ask how does one become impoverished, but how does one leave poverty - for that we need to focus on the wealthy and not the poor.\" This profoundly changed how I looked at a lot of problems, the people who are nonviolent are the same people don't die of lung cancer in many ways. That doesn't make a lot of sense at first, violence is exceedingly rare whereas lung cancer is exceedingly common, but hear me out. The attribute a person needs in life is to predict the consequences of their actions. Now I'm not saying that people in poverty, who do drugs, who get abortions, who don't finish school cannot predict the consequences of their actions, I'm saying they aren't as good at it as the wealthy, nonviolent, not-dying-of-lung-cancer-while-smoking people. And as a little thought exercise: imagine someone who could, with perfect accuracy predict the consequences of their own actions, just their own actions. That super-power would make this person exceedingly wealth, successful, healthy, and likely live a very long and happy life. It's not the most exciting power, but it virtually guarantees success against everything except randomness. This, I believe, is the attribute that causes violence. An acute case of bad luck, and poor predictive ability. </p>","src":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"metadata":{"isBasedOnUrl":null,"inLanguage":null,"starred":true,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"keywords":[]},"text":"Well, poverty is a good start, as is upbringing, the vicious cycle of violence, and law enforcement.
