So, how much does lead actually matter? That's a good question. And for me it all started with the gun debate. Now, the gun debate hinges on a single question, "does reduced availability of guns reduce crime?" There's lots of things people say on one side of the other about saving lives and numerous other things, but I personally do not care how I am killed - I prefer not to be dead. The data I've seen suggests that there is a tenuous link at best between guns and violence and depending on how you cherry-pick the data it can show whatever you want. That means to me: guns and violence aren't related. It's crazy I know, but then the much more interesting question becomes: 

# What is correlated to violence?

Well, poverty is a good start, as is upbringing, the vicious cycle of violence, and law enforcement. However, they aren't that related if you're a believer in hard science. Next we look at something like abortions a la the [Freakonomics][0]. However, abortions, drugs, and poverty are all interrelated - and that's not great for finding a cause. I investigated smoking a whole lot in my past, and one of the things I found just fascinating was how hard it was to "prove" that smoking lead to lung cancer. See, the core problem with what I read is that _some _people don't get lung cancer. Those people tended to be rich. Well if smoking gives you lung cancer, why doesn't it give rich people lung cancer?
